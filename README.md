# Welcome to Sparrow Sift Dynamic UI

I built sparrow Sift to basically build dynamic UIs as quickly as possible using next gen AI Engines.
I hope we can use it to render new websites in real time.

Please look into the procedure to use Sparrow Sift below:

## things to do

1. Finish Icons Done
2. Test with $ varaibles preferably and how to overcome those Done
3. update Ec2 / its working
4. Update Ec2 with main3.py and demerge teh siteDbs
5. make prompt to get good results , its hallucinatng the Compoennets
6. Add other shadcn Ui componenets and update it

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
